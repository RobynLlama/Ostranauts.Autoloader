AUTOLOAD.META

# Lines beginning with a hash tag are comments
# and are ignored by the interpreter
# when using this template you may remove them

# This instructs the loader which load LoadGroup
# Your mod belongs to.
# Valid values:
#   WithVanilla (vanilla content that does not use FFU)
#   FFUCore (FFU content that must finish loading before FFU mods)
#   AfterFFU (FFU mods that require FFU)
LoadGroup: WithVanilla

# One dependency on one line at a time
# Use the strName from the mod_info.json of the mod
# your mod requires to function properly
#
# In the future you be able to request a specific
# version of the mod via ModName@Version optionally 
# including a comparator such as < > ^ >= <= for 
# version resolution. The default behavior if a
# version is omitted is ANY. If Ostra.Autoloader
# cannot parse a mod's version it will store it
# as UNKNOWN and fail all matches except ANY
#
# Example: the sample mod provided by BBG has
# "strName": "Sample Mod",
BEGIN Dependencies
  # Sample Mod
END
