AUTOLOAD.META

# Lines beginning with a hash (#) are comments
# and are ignored by the interpreter.
# You may remove these comments when using this template.

# This instructs the loader which LoadGroup your mod belongs to.
# Valid values:
#   WithVanilla  - vanilla content that does not use FFU
#   FFUCore      - FFU content that must finish loading before FFU mods
#   AfterFFU     - FFU mods that require FFU
LoadGroup: WithVanilla

# Specify one dependency per line.
# Use the "strName" from the mod_info.json of the mod your mod requires.
#
# Future versions of the loader will support specifying required mod versions:
#   ModName@Version
# with optional comparators like <, >, ^, >=, <=.
#
# Examples:
#   Sample Mod@1.2.3
#   Sample Mod@>=1.0.0
#
# Currently, only the mod name is supported (no version filtering).
# If no version is specified, any version of the mod will be accepted.
#
# If a mod's version cannot be parsed, it will be marked as UNKNOWN,
# which causes version-specific matches to fail except when ANY is requested.
